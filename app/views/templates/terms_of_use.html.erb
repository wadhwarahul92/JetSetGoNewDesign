		<p>
			Broadly, the JetSetGo Platform and/or JetSetGo Website provides services in three spheres:
		</p>
		<h2>
			1. Operator Portal
		</h2>
		<p>
			This is essentially an enterprise management tool for Operators who wish to be registered on JetSetGo and in a way advertise the availability of their arcraft(s) on the JetSetGo Platform and/or JetSetGo Website. Under this portal, the Operators will be provided with the following:
		</p>
		<ul>

			</li>
			<li>
				Operators will have access to the back end of the Customer booking engine where the Operators can review and confirm charter bookings which are being made by Customers on the JetSetGo Platform and/or JetSetGo Website.
			</li>
			<li>
				A reporting and enterprise management tool which shall enable Operators to manage all administrative aspects of their day to day functioning to more seamlessly complete approval and other planning processes till the charter is complete and update aircraft and crew safety standards and certifications which can then be viewed by the Customer.
			</li>
			<li>
				Assist the Operators by connecting the Operators with third party suppliers of various services and parts, as required in the aviation industry.

			</li>
			<li>
				JetSetGo also caters to several other requests of the Customers and provides various other services including bookings of limousine services, special customised packages and other facilities on board or in airports etc.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			While the above is essentially based on access to the JetSetGo’s website, <a href="www.jetsetgo.in">www.jetsetgo.in</a>, the same is available offline as well and the Customers are free to contact us directly. If the Customers prefer to contact JetSetGo directly the Terms and Conditions on JetSetGo website will continue to be applicable.
		</p>

		<h3>
			I. PROCEDURE AND FEES FOR BOOKING
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Searching and reviewing aircraft(s) available on the JetSetGo Platform and/or JetSetGo Website is free and so is obtaining the indicative trip cost from the JetSetGo costing tool. Further joining and registering with JetSetGo by opening an JSG Account is also free. If a query is made offline, JetSetGo shall search and review aircraft(s) available and obtain the indicative trip cost from the JetSetGo costing tool.
			</li>
			<li>
				Once a Customer has opened an JSG Account, he/she may seek enquiries for the selected aircraft(s) from the Operators in order to confirm the charter price as available on the JetSetGo Platform and/or JetSetGo Website. For offline queries, JetSetGo will forward this to the relevant Operators in order to confirm the charter price and aircraft availability.
			</li>
			<li>
				While the costing tool attempts to provide as accurate as possible trip cost for the Customer, the final decision of the same is with the Operator and the Operator may override and either increase or decrease the automated trip cost to submit the final price to the Customer.
			</li>
			<li>
				Once the Operator submits a confirmation, the Customer will receive a notification and in the case of an offline query an e-mail with a follow up telephone call. If the Customer is satisfied with the fee quote, he/she may proceed to make a booking.
			</li>
			<li>
				At the time of booking, the Customer will be required to update passenger details which will include among other, passenger nationality (to trigger alerts for specific landing approvals).
			</li>
			<li>
				The Customer then proceeds to a third party payment gateway service provider website where the Customer shall be requested to pay a booking deposit which will be a percentage of the total charter value and the quantum of which will be clearly displayed before a booking is confirmed by JetSetGo. For offline queries, the customer will be provided with an invoice with bank and remittance details to be followed to complete the booking process.
			</li>
			<li>
				A charter booking needs to be done at least 48 hours prior to the actual travel time. Currently, a shorter duration between the booking and the travel date is not currently enabled on the JetSetGo Platform and/or JetSetGo Website. When a Customer requests a travel time which is of a shorter duration from booking to travel time, they will be prompted to speak to a customer care executive to manage the booking process off-line to increase the chances of getting a confirmed charter. In the case of discounted flights, the time duration limit will be 12 hours prior to the estimate departure time for the manual booking process to be triggered.
			</li>
			<li>
				JetSetGo shall remit such amount of the charter value, as agreed with the Operator to confirm the booking.
			</li>
			<li>
				For the remaining charter value (net of the initial booking deposit made), JetSetGo will get in touch with the Customer and seek a wire transfer directly to JetSetGo (or in some cases to the Operator directly) which is to be credited at least 24 hours prior to the journey. JetSetGo in turn shall remit the money to the Operator.
			</li>
			<li>
				It is pertinent to note that the invoice issued by JetSetGo will be for the full charter charges plus service tax and all other charges. Whilst the invoice will be issued by JetSetGo as a facilitator and platform, the contract of carriage and all liabilities associated thereof will be between the Operator and the Customer.
			</li>
			<li>
				Fees for other special services such as limousine renting etc. are separate.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>
			J. MODIFICATIONS TO BOOKINGS, CANCELLATIONS AND REFUNDS
		</h3>
		<p>
			All modification, cancellations and refund terms shall be as provided and communicated by each Operator or JetSetGo acting on behalf of the Operator at the time of providing the charter fee quote. Acceptance of such fee quote and the terms & conditions associated thereof will construe acceptance by the Customer of the modification, cancellation and refund policy quoted by the Operator to the Customer.
		</p>
