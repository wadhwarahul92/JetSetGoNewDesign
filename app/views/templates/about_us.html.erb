				At <b>JetSetGo</b> we do not recommend aircraft best suited to our needs (read financials and ease) but aircraft best suited to your needs. We do not present to you scarce availability or artificial demand but market availability as is where is at the same time decreasing the empty flying time you incur on an average charter. 
			</p>

				Take the case of Mr. Chowdhary who has been a regular customer of JetSetGo since inception – he belongs to a tier 2 city which has no private jet based out of his home city. Mr. Chowdhary would always contact his broker who would in turn contact another broker who would in turn contact a limited pool of operators who would then charge him to ferry flights to and from his city with layers of intermediary and opportunistic margins. Mr. Chowdhary was recommended JetSetGo and decided to give us a shot. He now gets everything he needs at the click of few buttons, the price transparency he always deserved, choice that never existed before, the ability to sell unutilized sectors providing better value for his travel spends and finally enjoys the true JetSetGo Edge- Superior unraveled flying experience with every aspect of the trip meticulously covered by the JetSetGo team to help Mr. Chowdhary "achieve".
