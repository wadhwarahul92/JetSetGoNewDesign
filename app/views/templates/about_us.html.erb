				<b>JetSetGo</b> is an exciting venture that will revolutionize the private aviation business in the region by re-defining the experience for private charter customers. Our end to end control of the value chain, exclusive collaborative partnerships and state of the art technology make this possible. Having India’s largest private jet fleet at its disposal, JetSetGo offers the shortest wait time for an aircraft and, in the case of unscheduled maintenance we have the unrivaled ability to provide you with a substitute aircraft in the shortest amount of time. While we continue to strive to reduce your waiting time, our security measures remain an industry elite. We carry out 29 more security checks than any other competitor to ensure that your flight experience is not compromised in any way.
			</p>
			<p>
              At <b>JetSetGo</b> it is our priority to recommend the aircraft that is best suited to you . We do not present artificial demand but real time market availability with respect to your location and as such,  greatly decrease the empty flying time you incur on an average charter. At JetSetGo, we prioritize your experience.
			</p>
          <p>Take the case of Mr. Chowdhary who has been a regular customer of JetSetGo since it’s inception – he belongs to a tier 2 city which does not base any private aircrafts. Mr. Chowdhary would always contact his broker who would in turn contact another broker who would in turn contact a limited pool of operators who would then charge him to ferry flights to and from his city with layers of intermediary and opportunistic margins. On recommendation, Mr. Chowdhary decided to give JetSetGo a shot. He now gets everything: the price transparency he always deserved, choice that never existed before, the ability to sell unutilized sectors – all this at the click of a few buttons. Finally he also enjoys the true JetSetGo Edge - Superior unraveled flying experience with every aspect of the trip meticulously covered by the JetSetGo team to help Mr. Chowdhary "achieve”.</p>
