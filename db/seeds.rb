# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)


# [
#     :super_admin,
#     :admin,
#     :operator,
#     :tech
# ].each do |admin_role|
#   AdminRole.create(
#                name: admin_role.to_s
#   )
# end
